## Central Limit Theorem Simulation{.smaller}
The CLT Simulation app is an educational tool that provides user to experience firsthand how the Central Limit Theorem works. The user
can study the Central Limit Theorem with respect two distributions - the Exponential Distribution and Binomial Distribution.

The Central Limit Theorem Simulation app consists of the following three tabs:

- What is Central Limit Theorem: This tab explains the Central Limit Theorem in brief and also explains how to use the application.
- Simulation: This tab provides user the facility to simulate central limit theorem for different sample and simulation sizes.The user can see the distribution of sample means in simulation and how it approximates to normal distribution as sample and simulation size increases.
- How does actual distribution look like?: This tab shows the user the actual distribution of sample data.

The application can be accessed at: https://saneshashank.shinyapps.io/cltsimulation/

The source code for this application can be found at: https://github.com/saneshashank/CLTSimulation

example of the calculation done (full code can be accessed at github link above).Reactive expression for evaluating exponential function:
  
    
    reExp <- reactive({
    # read value from lambda input  
    lambda <- input$lambda
    
    # number of simulations and sample size
    nosim <- input$NumSim
    n <- input$NumSample
    
    # Generate random samples and store in matrix sim.mat
    sim.mat <- matrix(rexp(n*nosim,rate=lambda),nosim)
    # calculate the theoretical mean
    theory_mean <- 1/lambda
    
    # calculate the theoretical variance
    theory_variance <- (1/lambda)^2
    
    ## call to draw actual distribution
    drawActual(sim.mat)
    ## Call function to draw plot
    drawPlot(sim.mat,theory_mean,theory_variance)
  }
  )


## 
Shown below is the Simulation tab, change the controls (marked in red box) to change visualization.

Finally the tab - How does actual distribution look like ? - shows the actual sample distribution.

Thank You and enjoy the App!!
