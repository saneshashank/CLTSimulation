# ShinyApp-CLT-Simulation
This is a Shiny Application to serve as an educational tool to visualize Central Limit Theorem for Binomial and Exponential Distribution.

The Central Limit Theorem Simulation app consists of the following three tabs:

- What is Central Limit Theorem: This tab explains the Central Limit Theorem in brief and also explains how to use the application.
- Simulation: This tab provides user the facility to simulate central limit theorem using for different sample and simulation sizes.The user can see the distribution of means of samples in simulation.
- How does actual distribution look like?: This tab shows the user the actual distribution of data.

The app can be accessed at: https://saneshashank.shinyapps.io/cltsimulation/
